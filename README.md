              Overview of the Simple Quiz Game Project
Project Title: Simple Quiz Game
Objective
The objective of this project is to create an engaging and interactive quiz game that presents multiple-choice questions to users.
The game will track the user's score based on their responses, provide immediate feedback for each answer, and summarize the overall performance at the end of the quiz.
Key Features
Multiple-Choice Questions: The game will present a series of questions, each with four possible answers (A, B, C, D). Users will select their answers by entering the corresponding letter.
Score Tracking: The game will keep track of the user's score throughout the quiz. For each correct answer, the score will increase, while incorrect answers will not contribute to the score.
Immediate Feedback: After each question, the game will provide immediate feedback, indicating whether the user's answer was correct or incorrect, along with the correct answer if the user was wrong.
Performance Summary: At the end of the quiz, the game will display the total score out of the total number of questions and provide a brief performance summary, encouraging users based on their results.
Customizability: The game can be easily modified to include additional questions, change existing questions, or adjust the answer options, making it adaptable for various topics and audiences.
Technical Details
Programming Language: The quiz game is implemented in C, a widely used programming language known for its efficiency and control over system resources.
Data Structures: The program utilizes a structure (QuizQuestion) to store each question, its options, and the correct answer, allowing for organized data management.
User Input Handling: The game employs standard input functions to capture user responses, ensuring a smooth interaction experience.
Control Flow: The game uses loops and conditional statements to navigate through questions, assess answers, and determine the final score.
User Experience
The quiz game is designed to be user-friendly and engaging. Upon starting the game, users are welcomed and presented with questions one at a time.
The simplicity of the interface allows users of all ages to participate without requiring advanced technical skills. 
The feedback mechanism helps users learn from their mistakes, making the game both entertaining and educational.
Potential Enhancements
GUI Implementation: Future iterations could involve creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user interaction and visual appeal.
Database Integration: Incorporating a database could allow for a larger pool of questions and user statistics tracking over time.
Timed Quizzes: Adding a timer for each question could increase the challenge and excitement of the game.
Multiplayer Mode: Implementing a multiplayer feature would allow users to compete against each other, adding a social element to the quiz experience.
